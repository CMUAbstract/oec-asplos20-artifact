# Compilation and Testing

Compilation is managed by CMake to facilitate straightforward compilation on
multiple platforms. Ensure that CMake is installed before proceeding. A
CMakeLists.txt file should be available in the test directory.

## Compile

Execute the following commands.

```bash
cd $HOME/git-repos/oec-asplos20-artifact/artifacts/fsfp-mprc/build/
cmake ../source/
make
```

## Run

After compilation, run the executable.

```bash
./fsfp_mprc
```
